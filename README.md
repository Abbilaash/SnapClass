## Setup & Usage
### Step 1: Setup Local Hotspot (No Internet)
We use [MyPublicWifi](https://mypublicwifi.com/publicwifi/en/index.html) to create a local area dead network
1. Download and Install MyPublicWifi.
2. Open the app, set:
   - Network Access = No Internet Sharing
   - Turn on hotspot
3. Note the IP address shown in the app. This IP will be used to access the server from other devices.

### Step 2:Install Python Dependencies
1. Clone this repository
```
git clone https://github.com/Abbilaash/SnapClass.git
cd SnapClass
```
2. Install requirements
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Step 3: Start the server
```
cd server
python app.py
```
Once started, the server runs locally on port ```5000```

## Access the Web Interface
- Teacher Dashboard (same server device)
```http://127.0.0.1:5000/admin```
Use the IP address shown in MyPublicWifi ad access the students portal

```http://<IP>:5000/test```
Replace <IP> with the one shown in the MyPublicWifi app after enabling the hotspot
